* About
  This project parses jar files and generates sqlite database with the
  data.

  I'm intended to use this database (or this project) in
  [[https://github.com/m039/cedet-x-android][cedet-x-android]] project to generate templates and for autocomplete.

* Usage
  If you want to use this parser, just tell me and I add more info
  about it.
  
* Note  
  This code is far from being perfect from my point of view, because I
  hadn't been coding in clojure (or lisp) for a long time.

* License
  Distributed under the Eclipse Public License, the same as Clojure.
